                                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
                                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

Besides stealing food, Cheero also loves to run around at odd hours of the night. He does not abid by the human sleeping schedule. Hope you are a deep sleeper when he's got the zoomies.</p>
                                <p>Cheero also has a cat friend. His mom was also adopted with him, they have a love-hate relationship. You may find them cuddling on the couch one minute, the next they may challenge each other on who can hiss the loudest.</p>

                                <p>When it's time to go outside, Bellum is the first to run. He loves the huge fenced yard and is always chasing the unlucky squirrels who decide to hang out there. Beware if you wear a hat, he will think you are a different person and start barking at you.</p>

                                <p>Millas is a Turquoise Green Cheek Conure. He is almost 3 years old now, he will hopefully live to be 35! He can say a lot of words, like "pretty bird," "how are you doing," and "good morning." Millas can also do a variety of tricks (with a provided treat of course). He can fly to you on command, spin in a circle, and wave.</p>
                                <p>Millas also enjoys "singing." He will chirp and scream bird noises to sing along to music. He will probably not win a Grammy for his singing...but we love him anyway. Watch your fingers when he is in a mood, he will give love bites. This is avoided with bribery in the form of sunflower seeds.</p>
